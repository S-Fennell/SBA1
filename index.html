              Instructions: 
              Start standing shoulder-width apart with your hands at your sides and your barbell on the ground. 
              Step up to the bar. Your shins should be close to the barbell. 
              Push your glutes back, hinge at your waist, and bend down to grab the bar. 
              Use an overhand grip to grab the bar. 
              Keep your neck neutral and your core engaged. 
              Take a deep breath, drive your feet through the floor and pull the bar up. 
              Stand straight up, squeeze your glutes and exhale.  
              Hold this stance for a beat, then exhale and hinge your torso to lower the barbell back on the ground. 
              Rest and reset.

            <h2>Meal Prepping</h2>
            <p class="margin">Meal prepping can save you time on busy weeknights by 
              making food available to heat and eat right when you get home. 
              It can also save you money: Meal planning helps ensure that you don't 
              buy things at the grocery store you don't need, and pre-prepped food is 
              more likely to get eaten so it reduces food waste. It's also easier to 
              eat healthy meals since the menu gets set in advance. You're less likely
               to choose a not-so-great option when you already have a
                healthy dinner at home, ready to go.

            <h2>How To Do Cardio</h2>
            <p class="margin"> I recommend exercising a 
              minimum of four to five days each week. One key part of this 
              schedule is to vary the types and intensity of exercise you do on 
              different days. By changing up your exercise routine regularly, you’ll 
              work different muscles and lower your risk for overuse injuries. 
              You also can avoid the trap of doing the same thing over and over 
              until you get bored and quit altogether.

              I recommend moderate-intensity exercise two or three days a week 
              for at least 30 minutes. You should break a sweat and be a little short 
              of breath during good moderate-intensity exercise, but still be able to carry on a conversation.

            <h2>Fasting 101</h2>
            <p class="margin">
              Fasting means abstaining from food and/or drink, whether entirely or partially.
               But it’s not always that straightforward.

              “There’s actually a range of ways to fast.
              
              Religious fasting: Many religions promote some form of fasting as a spiritual exercise.
              Intermittent fasting: There are different types of intermittent fasting, eating patterns
              that focus on consciously cutting back on calories for certain time periods. You intentionally 
              alternate between periods of eating and fasting (sometimes described as “patterns” or “cycles” of fasting).

              Restrictive diets: On the keto diet, for example, people who follow keto cut all carbs and sugars from their diets.
              Fasting before a medical procedure: Your healthcare provider might instruct you to fast before
              undergoing surgery or certain types of blood tests, imaging tests or diagnostic procedures.
              Talk to a healthcare provider before starting any sort of ongoing fasting, like for weight loss.
